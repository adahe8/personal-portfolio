// my choice: a local storage-based approach, so that when you load remote you can pull back the original data
    // also a strategic choice since I wrote that data and would like to keep that information on my site
// TODOs: 
    // UPDATE: allow the user to edit the dialog popup with a double click
    // CREATE: allow the user to add a card - make a form that prompts them for the extra data needed pop up
    // DELETE: add a delete button near each card (or do select and delete option) that allows users to delete cards from local
    
    // Note: the way I'm planning it, this would only work if the user loads from local and not if they load from remote
        // since then the data is not being pulled from modifiable local storage
