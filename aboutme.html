          <h2>Care, Craft, Creativity, Connection.</h2>
          <p>
            During my time as a UX Designer & Inclusive Web Developer at UC San
            Diego Library (‘23-’26), my supervisors introduced me to what was
            called the 4 C’s, as part of our team’s manifesto. Care means to
            attend to quality and detail in what you create because of the
            knowledge that you, other implementors, and users will return to
            that work again and again. Craft is sustaining and growing that
            quality of work over time, even when challenged. Creativity aligns
            with bravely sharing your craft, to refine it through collaboration.
            And connection means building bridges with teammates and users
            through your work to create collective impact.These values have
            since been ingrained in my design ethic.
          </p>
          <h2>Sustainable Development.</h2>
          <p>
            We’re in an age where increased energy consumption from global data
            centers is deeply impacting communities and the environment. When I
            learned about the “Sustainable Web Development” movement in 2024,
            and lead a web project exploring the topic for UC San Diego
            Library’s digital experience team, I subscribed to it. Now, I treat
            environmental impact as a KPI, and I utilize sustainable design
            hacks to scale up performance.

          <h2>Thinking globally, developing locally.</h2>
          <p>
            Traveling to my family’s home province in Henan China, studying
            abroad in Edinburgh, Scotland, and working within the IT services
            space in Bangalore, India for a summer has helped me realize that
            there are common patterns in the pain points users across the world
            face, and similar practices that could be improved within web
            development to make sites better serve the World Wide Web. This
            global perspective informs each step of my development practice.
